AnyMQ - Non-blocking message queue system based on AnyEvent

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use AnyMQ;
  my $mq = AnyMQ->topic('Foo'); # gets an AnyMQ::Topic object
  $mq->publish({ message => 'Hello world'});

  #  bind to external message queue servers using traits.
  #  my $bus = AnyMQ->new_with_traits(traits => ['AMQP'],
  #                                   host   => 'localhost',
  #                                   port   => 5672,
  #                                   user   => 'guest',
  #                                   pass   => 'guest',
  #                                   vhost  => '/',
  #                                   exchange => '');
  #  my $mq = $bus->topic('foo')

  $mq->publish({ message => 'Hello world'});

  # $bus->new_listener('client_id', $mq);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

AnyMQ is message queue system based on AnyEvent.  It can store all
messages in memory or use external message queue servers.

Messages are published to L<AnyMQ::Topic>, and consumed with
L<AnyMQ::Queue>.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Returns a new L<AnyMQ> object, which is a message bus that can
associate with arbitrary L<AnyMQ::Topic> and consumed by
L<AnyMQ::Queue>

=head2 topic($name or %opt)

Returns a L<AnyMQ::Topic> with given name or constructor options
C<%opt>.  If called as class method, the default bus will be used.
Topics not known to the current AnyMQ bus will be created.

=head2 new_topic($name or %opt)

Creates and returns a new L<AnyMQ::Topic> object with given name or
constructor options C<%opt>.  This should not be called directly.

=head2 new_listener(@topic)

Returns a new L<AnyMQ::Queue> object, and subscribes to the optional
given topic.  If called as class method, the default bus will be used.
